I feel a bit traumatized by this challenge - so I don't know if I can even talk about it :O ...but I will try! and FYI I used to LOVE the color orange - but now? - not so much!

The arrow icons were coming in too large and even when I went into the svg files I couldn't get them to be a reasonable size so I ditched them completely and used &#10094; and &#10095; instead. They aren't quite as bold but I like them. I did turn them orange when they are clicked on and turned the opposite one grey - so that was a bit of fun!

2 big problems I still have are:

If the user tries to click on a thumbnail a second time to select the Lightbox - it doesn't work - I tried location.reload(). but hate it as it jumps AND it removes anything a user might have in their cart.

Same idea, if a user messes around with add to cart etc and comes back to it again - if they click the plus button it starts at 2 instead of 1.
So to stop this I tried location.reload() again and got the dreaded jump thing AGAIN :(

Overall, I am actually happy with what I WAS able to accomplish.
